Financial risk is the measure of uncertainty of future returns. It is basically the dispersion or variance of returns. Two key concepts in financial risk:
- Returns
- Probability

There are two kinds of financial returns:
- Discrete returns: simply the percentage lift compared to previous period. It aggregates across assets.
- Log returns/continuous returns: mainly for financial model. It aggregates across time.

p.s.
- No clear example on what is the meaning of aggregate accross assets and time.
